# Change Log

## 0.1.3-preview.1

* **New Enhancement:** TODO.

## 0.1.2-preview.1

* **New Feature #5:** added unit tests for [`RandomList.cs`](/Runtime/RandomList.cs), [`TestRandomList.cs`](/Tests/Editor/TestRandomList.cs)
* **New Enhancement #2:** for performance, [`RandomList.cs`](/Runtime/RandomList.cs) now stores a list of element-frequency pairs, rather than only the element themselves. Each element has to be unique; the paired frequency indicates how many times that element will appear in one cycle of iteration.

* **Documentation:** changed the format of the Doxygen-generated HTML file to have a sidebar.

## 0.1.0-preview.2

* **Documentation:** added author information to [package.json](/package.json).
